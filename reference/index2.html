    <H1>The Orgin of Halloween</H1>
    <h4>Hugo Padilla</h4>

    <p style="color:green">Carving pumpkins, trick-or-treating, and wearing scary costumes are some of the time-honored traditions of <strong>Halloween</strong>. Yet, the Halloween holiday has its roots in the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain (a Gaelic word pronounced “SAH-win”), a pagan religious celebration to welcome the harvest at the end of summer, when people would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off ghosts. In the eighth century, Pope Gregory III designated <strong>November</strong> 1 as a time to honor <em>Saints</em>. Soon after, All Saints Day came to incorporate some of the traditions of Samhain. The evening before All Saints Day was known as All Hallows Eve, and later, Halloween. Here is a look at the origins of some of the classic Halloween traditions we know today.</p>

    <p style="color:darkblue">There is much debate around the origins of trick-or-treating, but generally there are three theories. The first theory suggests that during Samhain, Celtic people would leave food out to appease the spirits traveling the Earth at night. Over time, people began to dress as these unearthly beings in exchange for similar offerings of food and drink. 

        The second theory speculates that the candy boon stems from the Scottish practice of guising, which is a secular version of “souling.” During the <em>Middle ages</em>, generally children and poor adults would collect food and money from local homes in return for prayers for the dead on All Souls’ Day. <em>Guisers</em> dropped the prayers in favor of non-religious practices with the inclusion of songs, jokes, and other “tricks.”
        
        A third theory argues that modern American trick-or-treating stems from “belsnickeling,” a German-American Christmas <strong>traditions</strong> where children would dress in costume and then call on their neighbors to see if the adults could guess the identities of the disguised. In one version of the practice, the <em>children</em> were rewarded with food or other treats if no one could identify them.</p>
